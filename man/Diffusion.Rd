\usage{
drd(t, boundary = c("upper", "lower"), a, v, t0, z = 0.5, d = 0, sz = 0,
  sv = 0, st0 = 0, precision = 3)

prd(t, boundary = c("upper", "lower"), a, v, t0, z = 0.5, d = 0, sz = 0,
  sv = 0, st0 = 0, precision = 3, maxt = 10000)

rrd(n, a, v, t0, z = 0.5, d = 0, sz = 0, sv = 0, st0 = 0,
  precision = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{a vector of RTs.}

\item{boundary}{character vector. Which boundary should be tested. Possible values are \code{c("upper", "lower")}, possibly abbreviated and \code{"upper"} being the default.}

\item{a}{threshold separation. Amount of information that is considered for a decision. Large values indicate a conservative decisional style. Typical range: 0.5 < \code{a} < 2}

\item{v}{drift rate. Average slope of the information accumulation process. The drift gives information about the speed and direction of the accumulation of information. Large (absolute) values of drift indicate a good performance. If received information supports the response linked to the upper threshold the sign will be positive and vice versa. Typical range: -5 < \code{v} < 5}

\item{t0}{non-decision time or response time constant (in seconds). Average duration of all non-decisional processes (encoding and response execution). Typical range: 0.1 < \code{t0} < 0.5}

\item{z}{relative starting point. Indicator of an a priori bias in decision making. When the relative starting point \code{z} deviates from 0.5, the amount of information necessary for a decision differs between response alternatives. Typical range: 0.3 < \code{z} < 0.7. Default is 0.5 (i.e., no bias).}

\item{d}{differences in speed of response execution (in seconds). Positive values indicate that response execution is faster for responses linked to the upper threshold than for responses linked to the lower threshold. Typical range: -0.1 < \code{d} < 0.1. Default is 0.}

\item{sz}{inter-trial-variability of (relative) starting point. Range of a uniform distribution with mean \code{z} describing the distribution of actual starting points from specific trials. Minimal impact on the RT distributions. Can be fixed to 0 in most applications. Typical range: 0 < \code{sz} < 0.5. Default is 0.}

\item{sv}{inter-trial-variability of drift rate. Standard deviation of a normal distribution with mean \code{v} describing the distribution of actual drift rates from specific trials.     Minimal impact on the RT distributions. Can be fixed to 0 in most applications. Typical range: 0 < \code{sv} < 2. Default is 0.}

\item{st0}{inter-trial-variability of non-decisional components. Range of a uniform distribution with mean \code{t0} describing the distribution of actual \code{t0} values across trials. Accounts for response times below \code{t0}. Reduces skew of predicted RT distributions. Typical range: 0 < \code{st0} < 0.2. Default is 0.}

\item{precision}{\code{numerical} scalar value. Precision of calculation. Corresponds roughly to the number of decimals of the predicted CDFs that are calculated accurately. Default is 3.}

\item{maxt}{maximum \code{rt} allowed, used to stop integration problems (\code{prd} only).}

\item{n}{desired number of observations.}
}
\value{
\code{drd} gives the density, \code{prd} gives the distribution function, and \code{rrd} generates random response times and decisions (returning a \code{data.frame} with columns \code{rts} (numeric) and \code{response} (factor)).
}
\description{
Density, distribution function, and random generation for the Ratcliff diffusion model with eight parameters: \code{a} (threshold separation), \code{z} (relative starting point), \code{v} (drift rate), \code{t0} (non-decision time/response time constant), \code{d} (differences in speed of response execution), \code{sv} (inter-trial-variability of drift), \code{st0} (inter-trial-variability of non-decisional components), and \code{sz} (inter-trial-variability of relative starting point).
}
\details{
The Ratcliff diffusion model (Ratcliff, 1978) is a mathematical model for two-choice discrimination tasks. It is based on the assumption that information is accumulated continuously until one of two decision thresholds is hit. For more information, see Voss, Rothermund, and Voss (2004), Voss, Nagler, and Lerche (2013), or Wagenmakers (2009).
